      "Desc": "\u003Cb\u003ENew Features\u003C/b\u003E\r\n- Player status effects will now be stored when logging out.\r\n- UI now shows active status effects.\r\n\u003Cb\u003EChanges\u003C/b\u003E\r\n- Player database data structures have changed again, there is a higher chance than I\u0027d like that your character does not survive the conversion.\r\n- Creating a character should be less likely to break and give you a blond male swordsman with 0 stat points.\r\n- Number of skill points available in the skill window should now refresh when you job level up.\r\n- Fixed an issue where attempting to pick an item up off the ground would not disengage your current target lock.\r\n- Weapons with unique sprites will now show for their slotted variants as well.\r\n- Elemental chart adjusted a bit. Elemental armor now reduces same element attacks by 40%, and the weak element by 25%. Holy/Dark armor will still block all damage from it\u0027s element.\r\n- Defense formula adjusted a bit. Now subtractive defense is applied after skill modifiers but before elemental and race/size card effects.\r\n- Cleaned emote handling up and fixed some issues and incorrectly mapped emotes. Emote cooldown is working correctly again.\r\n- Monster elemental/critical attacks have unique visual effects and more monsters use them.\r\n- Sadly you can no longer stun bosses.\r\n- Fixed a bug where boss summoned minions would give drops, even though they correctly did not give exp.\r\n- Fixed an issue where monster skill names would display even in cases where they were not indented to.\r\n- Poison will stop dealing damage on monsters below 20% unless they\u0027ve taken damage from another source recently.\r\n- Fixed the sprite trail for two-hand quicken not displaying correctly.\r\n- Fixed an issue where monsters that should switch targets if you attack them while they\u0027re following another player would not do so if you were outside of their melee attack range."

      "Desc": "\u003Cb\u003EChanges\u003C/b\u003E\r\n- Changing between 1st jobs at the bard will no longer cause you to lose your job levels.\r\n- Added config option to change how exp values are shown in the player summary box in the top left.\r\n- Elemental armors and cards that change your element should now reduce (or increase) received elemental damage. If you\u0027re one of the guys that farmed a Ghostring card, ghost property unfortunately won\u0027t affect auto-attack damage.\r\n- Fixed the pneuma ground area not being visible due to it\u0027s shader not being included in builds.\r\n- Fixed a bug where boss monsters could have their skills interrupted with a knockback skill, even though they can\u0027t be knocked back.\r\n- Adjusted monster movement, their chasing behavior should be closer to how it works on official servers."

      "Desc": "\u003Cb\u003ENew Features\u003C/b\u003E\r\n- Job levels added. First jobs currently max at job level 70 as a temporary measure until 2nd jobs are added.\r\n\u003Cb\u003EChanges\u003C/b\u003E\r\n- Existing characters will be assigned a job level depending on their base level. If you\u0027ve used more skill points than your job level would allow you won\u0027t gain skill points until you break even.\r\n- Character info box in the top left updated, let me know what you think of the new layout.\r\n- Hotbars are now unique to each character. Existing hotbars before this update are unfortunately lost.\r\n- The character select window will remember your last selected character.\r\n- Refine rates buffed a little bit, success rate increased by \u002B10% for all upgrades on level 3 and 4 weapons and all armors. Hopefully makes up for the rareity of upgrade materials.\r\n- PC client build now downloads files as needed from the server which makes the download much smaller (~50mb).\r\n- Skill failed messages will now show in the chat log for certain types of skill failure.\r\n- Implemented steal skill and visual effect.\r\n- Fixed torches on maps not showing up correctly.\r\n- The self destruct skill cast by marine spheres now hurt you again (and anyone nearby).\r\n- Some monsters will now give up chasing if you kite them too long.\r\n- MVP boss monsters deal a little less damage and heal a little less often. They also have a little less defense.\r\n- NPC dialog and option boxes now display over top of other currently open UI rather than under it."

If sprites or maps don\u0027t change this can be used to update the client without re-downloading the whole thing.\r\n- On hit poison effect of the Boa card now works, on hit stun effect of the Savage Babe card now works.\r\n- Client now shows your lucky dodge stat.\r\n- Looters now can see items a little further (12 tiles) to match official behavior.\r\n- Fixed an issue that caused self targeted skills (Improve Concentration, Two-Hand Quicken, etc) to fail."

      "Desc": "\u003Cb\u003EChanges\u003C/b\u003E\r\n- Double click can be used to move items into/out of storage. Hold shift to attempt to move the entire stack of items without a prompt.\r\n- Client will now remember where the storage window was last time you opened it.\r\n- Cards that have effects based on refine level now work. This includes Orc Baby, Carat, Kappa, Megalith, Sting, Arclouse, Goat, Firelock Soldier, Gibbet, and Appocalypse cards.\r\n- New characters should now log in with full hp/sp. You should also get 15 apples, because apples are good.\r\n- Client builds now store the server version that it can connect to. If you have an out of date client you\u0027ll be notified when logging in and asked to update rather than stuff just breaking everywhere.\r\n- Casting provoke on an enemy that is within melee range will always cause the monster to change targets to attack you.\r\n- Provoked monsters will no longer change targets when attacked as long as it\u0027s target remains close enough to attack.\r\n- Number of damage ticks from envenom adjusted, scaling from 4 ticks of damage over 8s at level 1, to 11 ticks over 22s at level 10.\r\n- Perfect Dodge now works, though it currently appears as a Miss instead of Lucky. The effect is greater if you have more luck than your opponent."

This shouldn\u0027t result in anything noticeable but there could be unintended issues.\r\n- Item icons have all been updated.\r\n- Better handling of death state, the client should no longer ever get you stuck in a state where you cannot respawn.\r\n- If you log out while dead, you\u0027ll remain dead when you log in.\r\n- Drop rate of elunium and oridecon has been increased a bunch (roughly 1.5x~2x). See the updated monster guide link on the webpage for more info.\r\n- Some monster stats tweaked a little, particularly Ant Hell 2F mobs.\r\n- GTB\u0027s summons nerfed a little."
