- Client builds now store the server version that it can connect to. If you have an out of date client you'll be notified when logging in and asked to update rather than stuff just breaking everywhere.
- Casting provoke on an enemy that is within melee range will always cause the monster to change targets to attack you.
- Provoked monsters will no longer change targets when attacked as long as it's target remains close enough to attack.
- Number of damage ticks from envenom adjusted, scaling from 4 ticks of damage over 8s at level 1, to 11 ticks over 22s at level 10.
