::2025-4-11 (Version 6)
<b>Parties</b>
- Party system is added.
- Text commands are available to create and manage parties.
 * Use /organize "party name" (or /party) to create a party.
 * Use /invite "player name" to invite a player to an existing party.
 * Use /accept to accept a party invite.
 * Use /leave to leave your current party.
- Players within the same party and within 10 levels of each other will share experience.
- Parties can have characters outside of share range, but any experience earned from that player's contribution will not be shared with out of range party members.
- Monster experience is increased such that each player will gain only slightly lower exp than if they had solo'd the monster themselves.
- Party member hp/sp is visible on the party panel if the player is on the same map as you.
- The party leader will have their name shown with a star next to their name.
- Logging out will promote a random player to be party leader. If all players are logged out, the first party member that logs back in will be promoted to leader.

<b>Status Effects</b>
- UI now shows active status effects.
- Player status effects now have timers and are saved when logging out.
- Party member status effects are visible beside their name on the party panel if they are on screen of you.
- Status effects from party members will continue to count down when off screen but will not reflect their status correctly until the player comes within range.

<b>Skills and Effects</b>
- New/Updated player skills: Warp Portal, safety wall, pneuma, soul strike, frost diver, stone curse, magnum break, steal, signum crusis, agi up, agi down, cure, aqua benedicta, and probably a bunch more.
- New monster skills: Dark strike, power up, speed up, blood drain, dark blessing, hallucination, status effect attacks, summon minion, combo attack, stop, and lord of vermilion.
- Some status effects have adjusted effects:
  Poison: Deals 1/2 the damage of the attack that caused poison every second. Now useable on bosses. Enemies not engaged in combat will stop taking damage below half health.
  Blind: Reduces the stat contribution for hit/flee by 75% and caps attack/skill range to 5. Blind monsters they can't see players unless you hit them or stand next to them. Bosses can be blinded but it only reduces their hit/flee.
  Stone Curse: While petrifying you cannot perform regular attacks and your movement/cast speed will rapidly slow down.
  Dark Blessing: Monster unique status. When the duration expires, your hp will be reduced to 1.
- Visual effect for teleporting, players logging in and moving maps, and logging out.

::2025-01-25
<b>New Features</b>
- UI now shows active status effects.
- Player status effects will now be stored when logging out.

<b>Changes</b>
- Player database data structures have changed again, there is a higher chance than I'd like that your character does not survive the conversion.
- Creating a character should be less likely to break and give you a blond male swordsman with 0 stat points.
- Number of skill points available in the skill window should now refresh when you job level up.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to pick an item up off the ground would not disengage your current target lock.
- Weapons with unique sprites will now show for their slotted variants as well.
- Elemental chart adjusted a bit. Elemental armor now reduces same element attacks by 40%, and the weak element by 25%. Holy/Dark armor will still block all damage from it's element.
- Defense formula adjusted a bit. Now subtractive defense is applied after skill modifiers but before elemental and race/size card effects.
- Cleaned emote handling up and fixed some issues and incorrectly mapped emotes. Emote cooldown is working correctly again.
- Monster elemental/critical attacks have unique visual effects and more monsters use them.
- Sadly you can no longer stun bosses.
- Fixed a bug where boss summoned minions would give drops, even though they correctly did not give exp.
- Fixed an issue where monster skill names would display even in cases where they were not indented to.
- Poison will stop dealing damage on monsters below 20% unless they've taken damage from another source recently.
- Fixed the sprite trail for two-hand quicken not displaying correctly.
- Fixed an issue where monsters that should switch targets if you attack them while they're following another player would not do so if you were outside of their melee attack range.

::2025-01-17
<b>Changes</b>
- Changing between 1st jobs at the bard will no longer cause you to lose your job levels.
- Added config option to change how exp values are shown in the player summary box in the top left.
- Elemental armors and cards that change your element should now reduce (or increase) received elemental damage. If you're one of the guys that farmed a Ghostring card, ghost property unfortunately won't affect auto-attack damage.
- Fixed the pneuma ground area not being visible due to it's shader not being included in builds.
- Fixed a bug where boss monsters could have their skills interrupted with a knockback skill, even though they can't be knocked back.
- Adjusted monster movement, their chasing behavior should be closer to how it works on official servers.

<b>New Features</b>
- Job levels added. First jobs currently max at job level 70 as a temporary measure until 2nd jobs are added.
<b>Changes</b>
- Existing characters will be assigned a job level depending on their base level. If you've used more skill points than your job level would allow you won't gain skill points until you break even.
- Character info box in the top left updated, let me know what you think of the new layout.
- Hotbars are now unique to each character. Existing hotbars before this update are unfortunately lost.
- The character select window will remember your last selected character.
- Refine rates buffed a little bit, success rate increased by +10% for all upgrades on level 3 and 4 weapons and all armors. Hopefully makes up for the rareity of upgrade materials.

- Client now shows your lucky dodge stat.
- Looters now can see items a little further (12 tiles) to match official behavior.
- Fixed an issue that caused self targeted skills (Improve Concentration, Two-Hand Quicken, etc) to fail.

::2025-01-10

- Double click can be used to move items into/out of storage. Hold shift to attempt to move the entire stack of items without a prompt.

- New characters should now log in with full hp/sp. You should also get 15 apples, because apples are good.

- Casting provoke on an enemy that is within melee range will always cause the monster to change targets to attack you.
- Provoked monsters will no longer change targets when attacked as long as it's target remains close enough to attack.
- Number of damage ticks from envenom adjusted, scaling from 4 ticks of damage over 8s at level 1, to 11 ticks over 22s at level 10.
- Perfect Dodge now works, though it currently appears as a Miss instead of Lucky. The effect is greater if you have more luck than your opponent.
