                    <div class="contentzone" style="padding:20px;"><h3>About Ragnarok Rebuild</h3>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><p>Ragnarok Rebuild is a full from scratch remake of the RO client and server in Unity and C#, using websockets as the network protocol.</p>

        <p>This project aims to provide a shorter term streamlined experience for a small group of players to boot up a server and re-visit their experiences with Ragnarok Online together. Kinda like how you might with terraria or minecraft. Experience, drops, and game mechanics have been adjusted to make it reasonable to progress in a shorter time frame and with fewer players.</p>

        <p>The project source code is <a href="https://github.com/Doddler/RagnarokRebuildTcp">available on GitHub</a>, users with a lot of experience in unity and C# can make their own builds of the client and server. You'll need Unity (version 2022.3.59f1), .NET 9.0, and your own extracted assets from a proper RO client. No assets from RO or Gravity are included in the project itself.</p></div>
    <h3>Test Details</h3>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><p>A temporary server has been set up for the purpose of testing how well the multiplayer functionality holds up under use by multiple players. Be warned that this is an early test and many things are either unfinished or do not fully work.</p>
        <p> This test will run 1 week, starting on August 8th (6pm PST) and ending on August 18th (3am PST). Please read the information below on exact details on how this differs from a regular Ragnarok online server. After shutdown characters and accounts will be lost.</p>

        <p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px"><b><i>The test period has concluded, thank you everyone who participated!</i></b></p></div>

    <h4>Mechanics</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><ul><li>Balance in terms of monster difficulty, exp gained, monster drops, and item prices and effects, are heavily modified. An emphasis has been placed on being able to gear and participate in most content over the week long testing period.</li>
            <li>The bard at the South Prontera Camp will change you to 1st job once you reach job level 10. This is presently the only way to change jobs.</li>
            <li>Stats operate similarly to how they do pre-renewal, but not exactly.</li>
            <li>Many npcs are still placeholders and cannot be interacted with. Important NPCs (shops, item refinement, teleport npcs, etc) should all still be available.</li>
            <li>The location of all players currently on a map, as well as any powerful monsters, can be seen on the minimap.</li>
            <li>Player chat is visible map-wide. A server wide shout command (/shout) is available with basic mastery 7, but it will be disabled if abused.</li>
            <li>Kafra teleports and other warp npcs are all free to use.</li>
            <li>There is no penalty for holding items up to 100% weight limit.</li>
            <li><b>This site provides an accurate overview of monster spawns, item drop rates, and item effects for this test.</b></li></ul></div>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Jobs</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><ul><li>First jobs only are available.</li>
            <li>Max character level is base level 99, job level 70.</li>
            <li>Most first job skills are available for use, though some effects may be altered or differ from normal.</li>
            <li>Skills that were originally quest skills are either unavailable or cost skill points to acquire.</li>
            <li>While second jobs are currently unfinished, some second job skills have been made available for 1st jobs during this test. The prerequisites for these skills have mostly been changed. Available skills are:
                <ul><li>Swordsman: Two-hand Quicken, Charge Attack</li>
                    <li>Mage: Earth Spike, Heaven's Drive, Waterball</li>
                    <li>Archer: Beast Bane, Ankle Snare</li>
                    <li>Acolyte: Sanctuary, Resurrection</li>
                    <li>Thief: Enchant Poison, Sonic Blow (useable with any weapon)</li>
                    <li>Merchant: Adrenaline Rush, Hammer Fall</li></ul></li></ul></div>
    <br>

    <h4>South Prontera Camp</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><ul><li>New players will log in at the south prontera camp.</li>
            <li>The bard npc at the camp is responsible for providing job changes, and can additionally reset your job, stats, and skills as you like. He also provides players with some starting provisions.</li>
            <li>NPC services available at the camp start off limited, but as players level and reach certain milestones, the number of NPCs and services will increase.</li>
            <li>
                A set of signboards are available to track certain milestones and achievements. These are:
                <ul><li>Top 10 level players.</li>
                    <li>First player to reach certain level milestones (level 10, 20, 30, etc)</li>
                    <li>The first player to kill each mini-boss and MVP monster.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Any achievements earned will be announced to all online players. Achievements are exclusive and can only be earned by one player during the test period.</li>
            <li>For mini-boss/mvp milestones, the killer will receive an additional item reward, and all online players will receive bonus exp.</li></ul></div>
    <br>

    <h4>Monsters</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><ul><li>Monsters stats differ by varying amounts, but they should be roughly the same difficulty as before with some exceptions.</li>
            <li>Monster spawns have been modified a good deal.</li>
            <li>Drops are heavily modified, with rare items, especially those from rare monsters, increased heavily to support a short testing period.</li>
            <li>The location of powerful enemies and MVP bosses are shown on the minimap.</li>
            <li>Some custom monsters have been added.</li></ul></div>
    <br>

    <h4>Partying</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><ul><li>When in a party, experience you earn will also be shared with any other party member within 10 levels on the map. Your party can have members outside of share range, but you will be unable to share experience with or earn experience from those players.</li>
            <li>The amount of experience earned when sharing experience is slightly reduced for each non-contributing member (player that does not hit or take damage from the monster).</li>
            <li>Organize a party by right-clicking a player and select invite. Leave a party with the /leave command, or right-clicking your character info box in the top left.</li>
            <li>Party names must be unique and are visible to other players. Kill achievements will also record the party you were in when making a kill.</li>
            <li>If the party leader goes off-line, party leadership will be handed to another player.</li></ul></div>
    <br>

    <h4>Refining</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><ul><li>Refining items no longer breaks on failure, but simply downgrades the item by 1.</li>
            <li>You may sacrifice an additional copy of an item to gain a boost to your refine success rate and prevent downgrading on failure.</li>
            <li>Refined weapons provide both physical and magic attack power.</li></ul></div></div></div></td></tr></table>
